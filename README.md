# Juvus Engine for Multimedia Applications (JEMA)
## Description
The goal of the project is to develop an engine for creation of multimedia applications such as graphical demos, GUI programs or games. The engine is written entirely in C using the general concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP). At the moment, only the Windows platform (version 7 and higher) is supported, as the engine actively uses the Win32API. The engine itself and accompanying multimedia application can be compiled using MSVC or Mingw-w64 - GCC.
